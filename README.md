# CookIt

Co-operative cooking game developed in python for the Raspberry Pi equipped with an EveOne Board.

Players use potentiometers on the EveOne Board to move characters around and use the buttons to interact with 
cooking stations.

# Cooking Together

Players must work together to prepare burgers as each player only has access to half of the kitchen. 

This endless game has players frantically rushing around a kitchen and working together to beat their previous
high score.

# The EveOne Board

The EveOne board is a physical interface that connects to a RaspberryPi to create more functionality. This was used
to control the game. By pressing buttons and turning knobs on the board, players could move and interact on the screen.

This project allowed me to work on interfacing programs to alternative sources of input such as the EveOne Board.
