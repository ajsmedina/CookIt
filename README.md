# CookIt
Co-operative cooking game developed in python for the Raspberry Pi equipped with an EveOne Board.

Players use potentiometers on the EveOne Board to move characters around and use the buttons to interact with 
cooking stations.

Players must work together to prepare burgers as each player only has access to half of the kitchen. 

This endless game has players frantically rushing around a kitchen and working together to beat their previous
high score.
